//TODO - The message input is buggy... vertically centering the new text inside of it. I want it to start at the top. 
//? Does this have something to do with flexbox settings? Or is it just the nature of the input? How can I fix it? 
// While I do think this has something to do with the flex settings wrapping the children, it seems my primary problem could be solved by using *the right tool for the right job* 

//* ðŸ‘† the answers to all of these questions, and more! ðŸ‘‡
/* 
the INPUT element specifies a SINGLE LINE input - pressing enter, for example, escapes the input. Because it's a single line! If a user pressed enter in an element intended to contain only one line, then we would assume they're done and want to leave. 

We *could* spend forever trying to code to fix for that... or just use the element intended for MULTI-LINE inputs. The TEXTAREA component. 
? Textarea elements have a lot of properties, like cols and rows, value, and so on. 
? Cols? Wouldn't that split the text area up oddly?

//? Accessibility - how accessible is this form in its current state? How can I improve it? 
//* ARIA labels, alt tags and so on.... how do these specifically apply to a form?
