# Portfolio (in React)

Welcome to the repo for my current official portfolio - thanks for stopping by! In this readme you'll find some information about how the app was built, learn a little bit about my thought process as I built it, and how I'm constantly adding to it while I learn new things. 

This app was bootstrapped through Vercel & create-react-app. Built in React and styled with SASS. 


### Packages/Libraries 

- React-router-dom
- React Spring - for animations
- React-Rewards - because who doesn't love a bit of confetti?
- Sass - implemented 7-1 architecture.

### Style Guide 

![sampler](https://i.ibb.co/1sh3CqH/portfolio-current.jpg)


- Title elements - h1-h3 - Megrim Display 

This font is unique, and geometrical, reminiscent of the lanterns behind it. At large size the font is fun and eye catching. But anything too small and it becomes annoying. 

- Body/"generic" elements - p, li, general text - Lat 400/reg
- Links/"callout" elements - buttons, links - Lato 700/medium

"Lato" means summer in Polish, and the font lives up to its name with its warm, balanced typeface. It's easy to read, and comes in a range of sizes for high customization.
