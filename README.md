## Personal Portfolio of Ashley Bergsma 

Welcome to my portfolio â˜º Thanks for stopping by, if you're curious how this project was built and organized - keep reading! 

I bootstrapped this app through vercel and create-react-app. The deployed page lives [here](https://abergsma-dev.vercel.app/)

The app is built using React, styled with Sass and CSS. A few packages have been added in for functionality, like react-router-dom, and others for fun - like react-rewards! 

### Packages/Libraries 

- React-router-dom
- React Spring 
- React-Rewards - microinteratctions! 
- Sass 

Style is given to the page using Sass, files are organized with 7-1 CSS architecture in mind

Typefaces: 
- Josefin Sans for titles and headlines 
- Lato (reg) for the rest
