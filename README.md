# Portfolio (in React)

Welcome to the repo for my current official portfolio - thanks for stopping by! In this readme you'll find some information about how the app was built, learn a little bit about my thought process as I built it, and how I'm constantly adding to it while I learn new things. 

This app was bootstrapped through Vercel & create-react-app. Built in React and styled with SASS. 


### Packages/Libraries 

- React-router-dom
- React Spring - for animations (like the parallax sunflower animation)
- React-Rewards - because who doesn't love a bit of confetti?
- Sass - implemented 7-1 architecture. 

* Fontawesome is included for icons

- Title elements - h1-h6, special links - Josefin Sans 400/reg

Josefin Sans is inspired by the sans-serif styles from the 1920's, featuring a geometric face, with unusual and eye catching proportions. I picked this font because I appreciated the quirkiness of the x-height (half way from baseline to cap height, it gives it a really rounded and relaxed feel), and the flair added to some of the lesser used characters, like "z". 

The font gives the large titles of the page a vintage and balanced feel, that I feel balances the calming color palette. 

- Body/"generic" elements - p, li, general text - Lat 400/reg
- Links/"callout" elements - buttons, links - Lato 700/medium

"Lato" means summer in Polish, and the font lives up to its name with its warm, balanced typeface. In small sizes it's easy to read, and pairs with Josefin Sans harmoniously.
