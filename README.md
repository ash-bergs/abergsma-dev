## Welcome to my portfolio! 

This project was bootstrapped through Create-React-App and Vercel. I've built the app using React, and styled it using Sass. 

The current deployed page lives [here](https://abergsma-dev.vercel.app/)

### Packages/Libraries

Style is given to the page using Sass, files are organized with 7-1 CSS architecture in mind
